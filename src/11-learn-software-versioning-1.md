# Software Release Life Cycle

**Author:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle)

A **software release life cycle** is the sum of the stages of development and maturity for a piece of computer [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software). Cycles range from its initial development to its eventual release, and  include updated versions of the released version to help improve  software or fix [software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) still present in the software.

Computer users are most likely to be familiar with the *beta*  phase, as software products are sometimes publicly advertised as being  beta in order to reduce users' expectations of their reliability.

## Stages of development



## Pre-alpha

Pre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before formal testing. These activities can include [requirements analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis), [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design), [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development), and [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing). In typical [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. *Milestone* versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the feature is complete.



### Alpha

The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) (alpha is the first letter of the [Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet), used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using [white-box techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing). Additional validation is then performed using [black-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing) or [gray-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_box_testing#Grey_box_testing) techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as *alpha release*.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-alphadef-2)

Alpha software is software that is not thoroughly tested by the  developer no before it is released to customers. Alpha software may  contain serious errors, and any resulting instability could cause  crashes or data loss.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-3) Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-4) In general, external availability of alpha software is uncommon in [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software), while [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) often has publicly available alpha versions. The alpha phase usually ends with a [feature freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_(software_engineering)), indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be [feature complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete). A beta test is carried out following [acceptance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing) at the supplier's site (alpha test) and immediately prior to general release of the software as a product.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-5)



### Beta

"Beta test" redirects here. For the film, see [Beta Test (film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Test_(film)).

Beta, named after [the second letter of the Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta), is the software development phase following alpha. Software in the beta stage is also known as *betaware*.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-6) A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-7) Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it  than completed software, speed or performance issues, and may still  cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing  impacts to users, often incorporating [usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing). The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called *beta release* and this is typically the first time that the software is available  outside of the organization that developed it. Software beta releases  can either be public or private, depending on whether they are openly  available or only available to a limited audience. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization  and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a *preview*, *preview release*, *prototype*, *technical preview* / *technology preview* (*TP*),[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-8) or *early access*. Since the introduction of [Windows 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8), [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) has called pre-release software a *preview* rather than *beta*. All pre-release builds released through the [Windows Insider Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Insider_Program) launched in 2014 are termed "Insider Preview builds". "beta" may also indicate something more like a [release candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate), or as a form of time-limited demo, or marketing technique.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-9)

*Beta testers* are people who actively report issues of beta  software. They are usually customers or representatives of prospective  customers of the organization that develops the software. Beta testers  tend to volunteer their services free of charge but often receive  versions of the product they test, discounts on the release version, or  other incentives.



#### Perpetual beta

Main article: [Perpetual beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta)

Some software is kept in so-called *perpetual beta*, where new features are continually added to the software without establishing a final "stable" release. As the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) has facilitated rapid and inexpensive distribution of software,  companies have begun to take a looser approach to use of the word  "beta".[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-10) In February 2005, [ZDNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDNet) published an article about the phenomenon of a beta version often  staying for years and being used as if it were in production level.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-11) It noted that [Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail) and [Google News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News), for example, had been in beta for a long time although widely used; Google News did leave beta in January 2006, followed by [Google Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_Suite), including Gmail, in July 2009.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-12) This technique may allow a developer to delay offering full support and responsibility for remaining issues.



#### Open and closed beta

Developers may release either a *closed beta* also called *private beta*, or an *open beta* also called *public beta*; closed beta versions are released to a restricted group of individuals  for a user test by invitation, while open beta testers are from a larger group, or anyone interested. Private beta could be suitable for the  software that is capable of delivering value, but is not ready to be  used by everyone either due to scaling issues, lack of documentation or  still missing vital features. The testers report any bugs that they  find, and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be  available in the final version. Examples of a major public beta test  include the following:

- Early customers purchased a "pioneer edition" of the WordVision word processor for the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC) for $49.95. In 1984, [Stephen Manes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Manes) wrote that "in a brilliant marketing coup, Bruce and James Program Publishers managed to get people to *pay* for the privilege of testing the product."[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-manes19840403-13)
- In September 2000 a *boxed version* of [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.)'s [Mac OS X Public Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Public_Beta) operating system was released.[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-14)
- Microsoft's release of *community technology preview*s (*CTP*s) for [Windows Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista), between September 2005 and May 2006.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-15)
- From 2009 to 2011, *[Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)* was in public beta.

Open betas serve the dual purpose of demonstrating a product to  potential consumers, and testing among an extremely wide user base  likely to bring to light obscure errors that a much smaller testing team might not find.



### Release candidate

A *release candidate* (*RC*), also known as "going  silver", is a beta version with potential to be a stable product, which  is ready to release unless significant [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) emerge. In this stage of product stabilization, all product features  have been designed, coded and tested through one or more beta cycles  with no known showstopper-class bugs. A release is called *code complete* when the development team agrees that no entirely new source code will  be added to this release. There could still be source code changes to  fix defects, changes to documentation and data files, and peripheral  code for test cases or utilities. Beta testers, if privately selected,  will often be credited for using the release candidate as though it were a finished product. Beta testing is conducted in a client's or  customer's location and to test the software from a user's perspective.



### Stable release

Also called *production release*, the *stable release* is the last *release candidate* (*RC*) which has passed all verifications / tests. The remaining bugs are  considered as acceptable. This release goes to production. Some domains  (for example, [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution)), have two types of stable releases: normal, or stable releases and  long-term support (LTS) releases which are maintained for a longer  period of time.



## Release

Once released, the software is generally known as a "stable release". The formal term often depends on the method of release: physical media, online release or a web application.



### Release to manufacturing (RTM)

The term **release to manufacturing** (**RTM**), also known as "**going gold**", is a term used when a software product is ready to be delivered. This build may be [digitally signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing), allowing the end user to verify the integrity and authenticity of the  software purchase. A copy of the RTM build known as the "[gold master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio))" or GM [[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-16)[[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-17) is sent for mass duplication if applicable. This is terminology is  taken from the audio record making industry, specifically the process of [mastering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio)). RTM precedes general availability (GA) when the product is released to the public.

It is typically used in certain retail mass-production software  contexts—as opposed to a specialized software production or project in a commercial or government production and distribution—where the software is sold as part of a bundle in a related computer hardware sale and  typically where the software and related hardware is ultimately to be  available and sold on mass/public basis at retail stores to indicate  that the software has met a defined quality level and is ready for mass  retail distribution. RTM could also mean in other contexts that the  software has been delivered or released to a client or customer for  installation or distribution to the related hardware end user computers  or machines. The term does *not* define the delivery mechanism or volume; it only states that the quality is sufficient for mass  distribution. The deliverable from the engineering organization is  frequently in the form of a golden master media used for duplication or  to produce the image for the web.



### General availability (GA)

[![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/ProductEndOfLifeCycle.png/220px-ProductEndOfLifeCycle.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ProductEndOfLifeCycle.png)

Milestones in a product life cycle: general availability (GA), [end of life announcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_life_announcement) (EOLA), [last order date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_order_date) (LOD), and [end-of-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)) (EOL)

**General availability** (**GA**) is the marketing stage at which all necessary [commercialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization) activities have been completed and a software product is available for  purchase, depending, however, on language, region, electronic vs. media  availability.[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-18) Commercialization activities could include security and compliance  tests, as well as localization and worldwide availability. The time  between RTM and GA can be from a week to months in some cases before a  generally available release can be declared because of the time needed  to complete all commercialization activities required by GA. At this  stage, the software has "gone live".





### Release to the Web (RTW)

**Release to the Web** (**RTW**) or **Web release** is a means of software delivery that utilizes the Internet for  distribution. No physical media are produced in this type of release  mechanism by the manufacturer. Web releases are becoming more common as  Internet usage grows.



## Support

During its supported lifetime, software is sometimes subjected to service releases, [patches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)) or [service packs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_pack), sometimes also called "interim releases" or "maintenance release" (MR). For example, Microsoft released three major service packs for the [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) editions of [Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP) and two service packs for the [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing) editions. Such service releases contain a collection of updates, fixes, and enhancements, delivered in the form of a single installable  package. They may also implement new features. Some software is released with the expectation of regular support. Classes of software that  generally involve protracted support as the norm include [anti-virus suites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software) and [massively multiplayer online games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game). Continuing with this Windows XP example, Microsoft did offer paid  updates for five more years after the end of extended support. This  means that support ended April 8, 2019.



### End-of-life

See also: [End-of-life (product)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)) and [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware)

When software is no longer sold or supported, the product is said to  have reached end-of-life, to be discontinued, retired, deprecated,  abandoned, or obsolete, but user loyalty may continue its existence for  some time, even long after its platform is obsolete—e.g., the [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) and Sinclair [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum).

After the end-of-life date, the developer will usually not implement  any new features, fix existing defects, bugs or vulnerabilities (whether known before that date or not) or provide any support for the product.  If the developer is kind enough, they may release the source code, so  the platform will live again, and be maintained by volunteers.
