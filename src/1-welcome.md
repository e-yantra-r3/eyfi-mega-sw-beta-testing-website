# Welcome

Hello Beta-Testers! Welcome to eYFi-Mega Beta Testing Program. In upcoming few weeks we would like you to help us find bugs in our software. We have developed quite a few software for eYFi-Mega which we want to be bug-free before we release it to the general public. Hence, we want you all to help us.

Since most of you are going to be new to software testing, we have therefore collected and compiled series of articles which we got from the wonderful internet to teach you,

1. Software Testing
2. Version Control
3. Software Versioning

We take no credit in the preparation of these articles. We have just embedded those articles here for your convenience. So, before starting with the Beta-Testing of eYFi-Mega Software we would suggest you to go through the articles in order to understand the procedure and your role in this program better.

Over the next few weeks we will systematically release Beta-Testing document from each of our software here on this website, which you can consider your one stop destination for all Beta-Testing Program related information. So, Keep an eye on the **Announcement Page** for updates. **Github Issues** page of respective software will be used to notify any bugs in the software. Tutorial of which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ). We have also setup a dedicated **Discord Server** for this program, where we all can interact. If you have any queries you can reach us on the Discord Server.

Happy Beta-Testing!
