# Difference between Alpha & Beta Testing

**Author:** PP Pankaj, GeeksforGeeks

[Alpha Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/?p=294073)  is a type of software testing performed to identify bugs before  releasing the product to real users or to the public. Alpha Testing is  one of the user acceptance testing.

[Beta Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/?p=294134) is performed by real users of the software application in a real  environment. Beta testing is one of the type of User Acceptance Testing.

The difference between Alpha and Beta Testing is as follow:

| Alpha Testing                                                | Beta Testing                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Alpha testing involves both the white box and black box testing. | Beta testing commonly uses black box testing.                |
| Alpha testing is performed by testers who are usually internal employees of the organization. | Beta testing is performed by clients who are not part of the organization. |
| Alpha testing is performed at developer’s site.              | Beta testing is performed at end-user of the product.        |
| Reliability and security testing are not checked in alpha testing. | Reliability, security and robustness are checked during beta testing. |
| Alpha testing ensures the quality of the product before forwarding to beta testing. | Beta testing also concentrates on the quality of the product but collects  users input on the product and ensures that the product is ready for  real time users. |
| Alpha testing requires a testing environment or a lab.       | Beta testing doesn’t require a testing environment or lab.   |
| Alpha testing may require long execution cycle.              | Beta testing requires only a few weeks of execution.         |
| Developers can immediately address the critical issues or fixes in alpha testing. | Most of the issues or feedback collected from beta testing will be implemented in future versions of the product. |
