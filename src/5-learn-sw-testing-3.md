# Alpha Testing

**Author:** PP Pankaj, GeeksforGeeks

**Alpha Testing** is a type of software testing  performed to identify bugs before releasing the product to real users or to the public. Alpha Testing is one of the **user acceptance testing**.

This is referred to as an alpha testing only because it is done early on, near the end of the development of the software. Alpha testing is  commonly performed by homestead software engineers or quality assurance  staffs. It is the last testing stage before the software is released  into the real world.

**Objective of Alpha Testing:**

1. The objective of alpha testing is to refine the software product by  finding the bugs that were not discovered during the previous tests.
2. The objective of alpha testing is to refine the software product by  fixing the bugs that were not discovered during the previous tests.
3. The objective of alpha testing is to involve customer deep into the process of development.
4. The objective of alpha testing is to give better insight into the software’s reliability at the early stages of development.

**Alpha Testing Process:**

1. Review the design specification and functional requirements.
2. Develop comprehensive test cases and test plan.
3. Execute test plan
4. Log defects
5. Retest once the issues have been fixed

**Phases of Alpha Testing:** There are two phases in alpha testing:

**1st Phase:** The first phase of testing is done by  in-house developers or software engineers. They either use  hardware-aided debuggers or debugger software. The aim is to catch bugs  quickly. Usually while alpha testing, a tester comes across to lots of  bugs, crashes, missing features, and docs.

**2nd Phase:** The second phase of alpha testing is done by software quality assurance staff for additional testing in an  environment. It includes a black box as well as white box testing.

**Advantages of Alpha Testing:**

- Better insight about the software’s reliability at its early stages.
- Free up your team for other projects.
- It reduces delivery time to market.
- Early feedback helps to improve software quality.
