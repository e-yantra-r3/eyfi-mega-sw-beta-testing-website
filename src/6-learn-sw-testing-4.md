# Beta Testing

**Author:** PP Pankaj, GeeksforGeeks

**Beta Testing** is performed by real users of the software application in a real environment. Beta testing is one of the type of **User Acceptance Testing**.

Beta version of the software, whose feedback is needed, is released  to a limited number of end-users of the product to obtain feedback on  the product quality. Beta testing helps in minimization of product  failure risks and it provides increased quality of the product through  customer validation.

It is the last test before shipping a product to the customers. One  of the major advantage of beta testing is direct feedback from  customers.

**Characteristics of Beta Testing:**

1. Beta Testing is performed by clients or users who are not employee of the company.
2. Reliability, security and robustness are checked during beta testing.
3. Beta Testing commonly uses black box testing.
4. Beta testing is carried out in user’s location.
5. Beta testing doesn’t require lab or testing environment.

**Types of Beta Testing:** There are different type of beta testing:-

2. **Public Beta Testing:** Product is released publicly  to the world through online channels and data can be collected from  anyone. Based on feedback, product improvements can be done. For  example, Microsoft conducted the largest of all Beta Tests for its  operating system Windows 8 before officially releasing it.
3. **Technical Beta Testing:** Product is released to a  group of employees of an organization and collects feedback/data from  the employees of the organization.
4. **Focused Beta Testing:** Software product is released  to the market for collecting feedback on specific features of the  program. For example, important functionality of the software.
