# Introduction to Software Testing

**Author:**  **[Aditya Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-gupta-437504a7?trk=hp-identity-name)**, GeeksforGeeks

**Definition**: The process or method of finding error/s in a software application or program so that the application functions  according to the end user's requirement is called software testing.

So, it's basically a process of verifying and validating that a  software or application is bug free, meets the technical requirements as guided by it’s design and development and meets the user requirements  effectively and efficiently with handling all the exceptional and  boundary cases.

The process of software testing aims not only at finding faults in  the existing software but also at finding measures to improve the  software in terms of efficiency, accuracy and usability. It mainly aims  at measuring specification, functionality and performance of a software  program or application.

**Software testing can be divided into two steps:**

1. **Verification:** it refers to the set of tasks that ensure that software correctly implements a specific function.
2. **Validation:** it refers to a different set of tasks that ensure that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements.

**Verification:** “Are we building the product right?”

**Validation:**  “Are we building the right product?”

**What are different types of software testing?**

Software Testing can be broadly classified into two types:

**Manual Testing:** Manual testing includes testing a  software manually, i.e., without using any automated tool or any script. In this type, the tester takes over the role of an end-user and tests  the software to identify any unexpected behavior or bug. There are  different stages for manual testing such as unit testing, integration  testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

Testers use test plans, test cases, or test scenarios to test a  software to ensure the completeness of testing. Manual testing also  includes exploratory testing, as testers explore the software to  identify errors in it.

**Automation Testing:** Automation testing, which is  also known as Test Automation, is when the tester writes scripts and  uses another software to test the product. This process involves  automation of a manual process. Automation Testing is used to re-run the test scenarios that were performed manually, quickly, and repeatedly.

Apart from regression testing, automation testing is also used to  test the application from load, performance, and stress point of view.  It increases the test coverage, improves accuracy, and saves time and  money in comparison to manual testing.

**What are different techniques of Software Testing?**

Software techniques can be majorly classified into two categories:

1. **Black Box Testing:** The technique of testing in  which the tester doesn’t have access to the source code of the software  and is conducted at the software interface without concerning with the  internal logical structure of the software is known as black box  testing.
2. **White-Box Testing:** The technique of testing in  which the tester is aware of the internal workings of the product, have  access to it’s source code and is conducted by making sure that all  internal operations are performed according to the specifications is  known as white box testing.

**What are different levels of software testing?**

Software level testing can be majorly classified into 4 levels:

1. **Unit Testing:** A level of the software testing  process where individual units/components of a software/system are  tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software  performs as designed.
2. **Integration Testing:** A level of the software  testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a  group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the  interaction between integrated units.
3. **System Testing:** A level of the software testing  process where a complete, integrated system/software is tested. The  purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the  specified requirements.
4. **Acceptance Testing:** A level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business  requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

Note: Software testing is a very broad and vast topic and is  considered to be an integral and very important part of software  development and hence should be given it’s due importance.
