<p>Hello Beta-Testers! Welcome to eYFi-Mega Beta Testing Program. In upcoming few weeks we would like you to help us find bugs in our software. We have developed quite a few software for eYFi-Mega which we want to bug-free before we release it to the general public. Hence, we want you all to help us. </p>
<p>Since most of you are going to be new to software testing, we have therefore collected and compiled series of articles which we got from the wonderful internet to teach you software testing and versioning,</p>
<ol>
<li>Software Testing</li>
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>Software Versioning</li>
</ol>
<p>We take no credit in the preparation of these articles. We have just embedded those articles here for your convenience. So, before starting with the Beta-Testing of eYFi-Mega Software we would suggest you to go through the articles in order to understand the procedure and your role in this program better.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks we will systematically release Beta-Testing document from each of our software here on this website, which you can consider your one stop destination for all Beta-Testing Program related information. So, Keep an eye on the <strong>Announcement Page</strong> for updates. <strong>Github Issues</strong> page of respective software will be used to notify any bugs in the software. Tutorial of which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ">here</a>. We have also setup a dedicated <strong>Discord Server</strong> for this program, where we all can interact. If you have any queries you can reach us on the Discord Server.</p>
<p>Happy Beta-Testing!</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong>  <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-gupta-437504a7?trk=hp-identity-name">Aditya Gupta</a></strong>, GeeksforGeeks</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The process or method of finding error/s in a software application or program so that the application functions according to the end user's requirement is called software testing.</p>
<p>So, it's basically a process of verifying and validating that a software or application is bug free, meets the technical requirements as guided by it’s design and development and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently with handling all the exceptional and boundary cases.</p>
<p>The process of software testing aims not only at finding faults in the existing software but also at finding measures to improve the software in terms of efficiency, accuracy and usability. It mainly aims at measuring specification, functionality and performance of a software program or application.</p>
<p><strong>Software testing can be divided into two steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> it refers to the set of tasks that ensure that software correctly implements a specific function.</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> it refers to a different set of tasks that ensure that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> “Are we building the product right?”</p>
<p><strong>Validation:</strong>  “Are we building the right product?”</p>
<p><strong>What are different types of software testing?</strong></p>
<p>Software Testing can be broadly classified into two types:</p>
<p><strong>Manual Testing:</strong> Manual testing includes testing a software manually, i.e., without using any automated tool or any script. In this type, the tester takes over the role of an end-user and tests the software to identify any unexpected behavior or bug. There are different stages for manual testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.</p>
<p>Testers use test plans, test cases, or test scenarios to test a software to ensure the completeness of testing. Manual testing also includes exploratory testing, as testers explore the software to identify errors in it.</p>
<p><strong>Automation Testing:</strong> Automation testing, which is also known as Test Automation, is when the tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the product. This process involves automation of a manual process. Automation Testing is used to re-run the test scenarios that were performed manually, quickly, and repeatedly.</p>
<p>Apart from regression testing, automation testing is also used to test the application from load, performance, and stress point of view. It increases the test coverage, improves accuracy, and saves time and money in comparison to manual testing.</p>
<p><strong>What are different techniques of Software Testing?</strong></p>
<p>Software techniques can be majorly classified into two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Black Box Testing:</strong> The technique of testing in which the tester doesn’t have access to the source code of the software and is conducted at the software interface without concerning with the internal logical structure of the software is known as black box testing.</li>
<li><strong>White-Box Testing:</strong> The technique of testing in which the tester is aware of the internal workings of the product, have access to it’s source code and is conducted by making sure that all internal operations are performed according to the specifications is known as white box testing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What are different levels of software testing?</strong></p>
<p>Software level testing can be majorly classified into 4 levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where individual units/components of a software/system are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.</li>
<li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.</li>
<li><strong>System Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system/software is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Software testing is a very broad and vast topic and is considered to be an integral and very important part of software development and hence should be given it’s due importance.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>Testing is a process of executing a program with the aim of finding error. To make our software perform well it should be error free. If testing is done successfully it will remove all the errors from the software.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#principles-of-testing" id="principles-of-testing">Principles of Testing</a></h3>
<p>(i) All the test should meet the customer requirements </p>
<p>(ii) To make our software testing should be performed by third party </p>
<p>(iii) Exhaustive testing is not possible. As we need the optimal amount of testing based on the risk assessment of the application. (iv) All the test to be conducted should be planned before implementing it </p>
<p>v) It follows pareto rule(80/20 rule) which states that 80% of errors comes from 20% of program components. </p>
<p>(vi) Start testing with small parts and extend it to large parts.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#types-of-testing" id="types-of-testing">Types of Testing</a></h3>
<h3><a class="header" href="#1-unit-testing" id="1-unit-testing">1. Unit Testing</a></h3>
<p>It focuses on smallest unit of software design. In this we test an individual unit or group of inter related <a href="http://units.It">units.It</a> is often done by programmer by using sample input and observing its corresponding outputs. Example:</p>
<pre><code>a) In a program we are checking if loop, method or 
   function is working fine
b) Misunderstood or incorrect, arithmetic precedence.
c) Incorrect initialization
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#2-integration-testing" id="2-integration-testing">2. Integration Testing</a></h3>
<p>The objective is to take unit tested components and build a program structure that has been dictated by design.Integration testing is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output.</p>
<p>Integration testing is of four types: (i) Top down (ii) Bottom up (iii) Sandwich (iv) Big-Bang Example</p>
<pre><code>(a) Black Box testing:- It is used for validation. 
In this we ignores internal working mechanism and 
focuses on what is the output?.

(b) White Box testing:- It is used for verification. 
In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e.
how the output is achieved?
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#3-regression-testing" id="3-regression-testing">3. Regression Testing</a></h3>
<p>Every time new module is added leads to changes in program. This type of testing make sure that whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program. Example</p>
<pre><code>In school record suppose we have module staff, students 
and finance combining these modules and checking if on 
integration these module works fine is regression testing
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#4-smoke-testing" id="4-smoke-testing">4. Smoke Testing</a></h3>
<p>This test is done to make sure that software under testing is ready or stable for further testing It is called smoke test as testing initial pass is done to check if it did not catch the fire or smoked in the initial switch on. Example:</p>
<pre><code>If project has 2 modules so before going to module 
make sure that module 1 works properly
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#5-alpha-testing" id="5-alpha-testing">5. Alpha Testing</a></h3>
<p>This is a type of validation testing. It is a type of  <em>acceptance testing</em> which is done before the product is released to customers. It is typically done by QA people. Example:</p>
<pre><code>When software testing is performed internally within
the organization
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#6-beta-testing" id="6-beta-testing">6. Beta Testing</a></h3>
<p>The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software. This version is released for the limited number of users for testing in real time environment Example:</p>
<pre><code>When software testing is performed for the limited
number of people
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#7-system-testing" id="7-system-testing">7. System Testing</a></h3>
<p>In this software is tested such that it works fine for different operating system. It is covered under the black box testing technique. In this we just focus on required input and output without focusing on internal working. In this we have security testing, recovery testing , stress testing and performance testing Example:</p>
<pre><code>This include functional as well as non functional 
testing
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#8-stress-testing" id="8-stress-testing">8. Stress Testing</a></h3>
<p>In this we gives unfavorable conditions to the system and check how they perform in those condition. Example:</p>
<pre><code>(a) Test cases that require maximum memory or other
    resources are executed
(b) Test cases that may cause thrashing in a virtual 
    operating system
(c) Test cases that may cause excessive disk requirement
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#9-performance-testing" id="9-performance-testing">9. Performance Testing</a></h3>
<p>It is designed to test the run-time performance of software within the context of an integrated system. It is used to test speed and effectiveness of program. Example:</p>
<pre><code>Checking number of processor cycles.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> PP Pankaj, GeeksforGeeks</p>
<p><strong>Alpha Testing</strong> is a type of software testing performed to identify bugs before releasing the product to real users or to the public. Alpha Testing is one of the <strong>user acceptance testing</strong>.</p>
<p>This is referred to as an alpha testing only because it is done early on, near the end of the development of the software. Alpha testing is commonly performed by homestead software engineers or quality assurance staffs. It is the last testing stage before the software is released into the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Objective of Alpha Testing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The objective of alpha testing is to refine the software product by finding the bugs that were not discovered during the previous tests.</li>
<li>The objective of alpha testing is to refine the software product by fixing the bugs that were not discovered during the previous tests.</li>
<li>The objective of alpha testing is to involve customer deep into the process of development.</li>
<li>The objective of alpha testing is to give better insight into the software’s reliability at the early stages of development.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Alpha Testing Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Review the design specification and functional requirements.</li>
<li>Develop comprehensive test cases and test plan.</li>
<li>Execute test plan</li>
<li>Log defects</li>
<li>Retest once the issues have been fixed</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Phases of Alpha Testing:</strong> There are two phases in alpha testing:</p>
<p><strong>1st Phase:</strong> The first phase of testing is done by in-house developers or software engineers. They either use hardware-aided debuggers or debugger software. The aim is to catch bugs quickly. Usually while alpha testing, a tester comes across to lots of bugs, crashes, missing features, and docs.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Phase:</strong> The second phase of alpha testing is done by software quality assurance staff for additional testing in an environment. It includes a black box as well as white box testing.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Alpha Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Better insight about the software’s reliability at its early stages.</li>
<li>Free up your team for other projects.</li>
<li>It reduces delivery time to market.</li>
<li>Early feedback helps to improve software quality.</li>

<p><strong>Beta Testing</strong> is performed by real users of the software application in a real environment. Beta testing is one of the type of <strong>User Acceptance Testing</strong>.</p>
<p>Beta version of the software, whose feedback is needed, is released to a limited number of end-users of the product to obtain feedback on the product quality. Beta testing helps in minimization of product failure risks and it provides increased quality of the product through customer validation.</p>
<p>It is the last test before shipping a product to the customers. One of the major advantage of beta testing is direct feedback from customers.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Beta Testing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Beta Testing is performed by clients or users who are not employee of the company.</li>
<li>Reliability, security and robustness are checked during beta testing.</li>
<li>Beta Testing commonly uses black box testing.</li>
<li>Beta testing is carried out in user’s location.</li>
<li>Beta testing doesn’t require lab or testing environment.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Types of Beta Testing:</strong> There are different type of beta testing:-</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Traditional Beta testing:</strong> Product is distributed to the target market and related data is gathered in all aspects. This data can be used for Product improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Public Beta Testing:</strong> Product is released publicly to the world through online channels and data can be collected from anyone. Based on feedback, product improvements can be done. For example, Microsoft conducted the largest of all Beta Tests for its operating system Windows 8 before officially releasing it.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Beta Testing:</strong> Product is released to a group of employees of an organization and collects feedback/data from the employees of the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Focused Beta Testing:</strong> Software product is released to the market for collecting feedback on specific features of the program. For example, important functionality of the software.</li>
<li><strong>Post-release Beta Testing:</strong> Software product is released to the market and data is collected to make improvements for the future release of the product.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Criteria for Beta Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sign off a document on Alpha testing.</li>
<li>Beta version of the software should be ready</li>
<li>Environment ready to release the software application to the public</li>
<li>Tool to capture real time faults</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Beta Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It reduces product failure risk via customer validation.</li>
<li>Beta Testing allows a company to test post-launch infrastructure.</li>
<li>It helps in improving product quality via customer feedback.</li>
<li>Cost effective compared to similar data gathering methods.</li>
<li>It creates goodwill with customers and increases customer satisfaction.</li>

<p>Version Control (aka Revision Control aka Source Control) lets you track your files over time. Why do you care? So when you mess up you can easily get back to a previous working version.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve probably cooked up your own</strong> version control system without realizing it had such a geeky name. Got any files like this? (Not these exact ones I hope).</p>
<ul>
<li>KalidAzadResumeOct2014.doc</li>
<li>KalidAzadResumeMar2015.doc</li>
<li>instacalc-logo3.png</li>
<li>instacalc-logo4.png</li>
<li>logo-old.png</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It’s why we use “Save As”.</strong> You want the new file without obliterating the old one. It’s a common problem, and solutions are usually like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>single backup copy</strong> (Document.old.txt).</li>
<li>If we’re clever, we add a <strong>version number or date</strong>: Document_V1.txt, DocumentMarch2015.txt</li>
<li>We may even use a <strong>shared folder</strong> so other people can see and edit files without sending them over email. Hopefully they relabel the file after they save it.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#so-why-do-we-need-a-version-control-system-vcs" id="so-why-do-we-need-a-version-control-system-vcs">So Why Do We Need A Version Control System (VCS)?</a></h2>
<p>Our shared folder/naming system is fine for class projects or one-time papers. But software projects? Not a chance.</p>
<p>Do you think the Windows source code sits in a shared folder like “Windows2007-Latest-UPDATED!!”, for anyone to edit? That every programmer just works in a different subfolder? No way.</p>
<p>Large, fast-changing projects with many authors need a Version Control System (geekspeak for “file database”) to track changes and avoid general chaos. A good VCS does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backup and Restore.</strong> Files are saved as they are edited, and you can jump to any moment in time. Need that file as it was on Feb 23, 2007? No problem.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization.</strong> Lets people share files and stay up-to-date with the latest version.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term undo.</strong> Monkeying with a file and messed it up? (That’s just like you, isn’t it?). Throw away your changes and go back to the “last known good” version in the database.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term undo.</strong> Sometimes we mess up bad. Suppose you made a change a year ago, and it had a bug. Jump back to the old version, and see what change was made that day.</li>
<li><strong>Track Changes</strong>. As files are updated, you can leave messages explaining why the change happened (stored in the VCS, not the file). This makes it easy to see how a file is evolving over time, and why.</li>
<li><strong>Track Ownership.</strong> A VCS tags every change with the name of the person who made it. Helpful for <del><a href="http://www.unwords.com/unword/blamestorming.html">blamestorming</a></del> giving credit.</li>
<li><strong>Sandboxing</strong>, or insurance against yourself. Making a big change? You can make temporary changes in an isolated area, test and work out the kinks before “checking in” your changes.</li>
<li><strong>Branching and merging</strong>. A larger sandbox. You can <strong>branch</strong> a copy of your code into a separate area and modify it in isolation (tracking changes separately). Later, you can <strong>merge</strong> your work back into the common area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shared folders are quick and simple, but can’t beat these features.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#learn-the-lingo" id="learn-the-lingo">Learn The Lingo</a></h2>
<p>Most version control systems involve the following concepts, though the labels may be different.</p>
<p>Basic Setup</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repository (repo)</strong>: The database storing the files.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong>: The computer storing the repo.</li>
<li><strong>Client</strong>: The computer connecting to the repo.</li>
<li><strong>Working Set/Working Copy</strong>: Your local directory of files, where you make changes.</li>
<li><strong>Trunk/Main</strong>: The primary location for code in the repo. Think of code as a family tree — the trunk is the main line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic Actions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add</strong>: Put a file into the repo for the first time, i.e. begin tracking it with Version Control.</li>
<li><strong>Revision</strong>: What version a file is on (v1, v2, v3, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Head</strong>: The latest revision in the repo.</li>
<li><strong>Check out</strong>: Download a file from the repo.</li>
<li><strong>Check in</strong>: Upload a file to the repository (if it has changed). The file gets a new revision number, and people can “check out” the latest one.</li>
<li><strong>Checkin Message</strong>: A short message describing what was changed.</li>
<li><strong>Changelog/History</strong>: A list of changes made to a file since it was created.</li>
<li><strong>Update/Sync</strong>: Synchronize your files with the latest from the repository. This lets you grab the latest revisions of all files.</li>
<li><strong>Revert</strong>: Throw away your local changes and reload the latest version from the repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced Actions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch</strong>: Create a separate copy of a file/folder for private use (bug fixing, testing, etc). Branch is both a verb (“branch the code”) and a noun (“Which branch is it in?”).</li>
<li><strong>Diff/Change/Delta</strong>: Finding the differences between two files. Useful for seeing what changed between revisions.</li>
<li><strong>Merge (or patch)</strong>: Apply the changes from one file to another, to bring it up-to-date. For example, you can merge features from one branch into another. (At Microsoft this was called <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/01/364840.aspx">Reverse Integrate and Forward Integrate</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: When pending changes to a file contradict each other (both changes cannot be applied).</li>
<li><strong>Resolve</strong>: Fixing the changes that contradict each other and checking in the correct version.</li>
<li><strong>Locking</strong>: Taking control of a file so nobody else can edit it until you unlock it. Some version control systems use this to avoid conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking the lock</strong>: Forcibly unlocking a file so you can edit it. It may be needed if someone locks a file and goes on vacation (or “calls in sick” the day Halo 3 comes out).</li>
<li><strong>Check out for edit</strong>: Checking out an “editable” version of a file. Some VCSes have editable files by default, others require an explicit command.</li>
</ul>
<p>And a typical scenario goes like this:</p>
<p>Alice <strong>adds</strong> a file (<code>list.txt</code>) to the <strong>repository</strong>. She <strong>checks it out</strong>, makes a change (puts “milk” on the list), and checks it back in with a checkin message (“Added required item.”). The next morning, Bob <strong>updates</strong> his local working set and sees the latest revision of <code>list.txt</code>, which contains “milk”. He can browse the <strong>changelog</strong> or <strong>diff</strong> to see that Alice put “milk” the day before.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#visual-examples" id="visual-examples">Visual Examples</a></h2>
<p>This guide is purposefully high-level: most tutorials throw a bunch of text commands at you. Let’s cover the high-level concepts without getting stuck in the syntax (the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion manual</a> is always there, don’t worry). Sometimes it’s nice to <strong>see what’s possible</strong>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#checkins" id="checkins">Checkins</a></h2>
<p>The simplest scenario is checking in a file (<code>list.txt</code>) and modifying it over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/basic_checkin.png" alt="version control checkin" /></p>
<p>Each time we check in a new version, we get a new revision (r1, r2, r3, etc.). In Subversion you’d do:</p>
<pre><code>svn add list.txt
(modify the file)
svn ci list.txt -m &quot;Changed the list&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag is the message to use for this checkin.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#checkouts-and-editing" id="checkouts-and-editing">Checkouts And Editing</a></h2>
<p>In reality, you might not keep checking in a file. You may have to <strong>check out, edit and check in</strong>. The cycle looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/checkout_edit.png" alt="version control checkout" /></p>
<p>If you don’t like your changes and want to start over, you can <strong>revert</strong> to the previous version and start again (or stop). When checking out, you get the latest revision by default. If you want, you can specify a particular revision. In Subversion, run:</p>
<pre><code>svn co list.txt (get latest version)
…edit file…
svn revert list.txt (throw away changes)
svn co -r2 list.txt (check out particular version)
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#diffs" id="diffs">Diffs</a></h2>
<p>The trunk has a history of <strong>changes</strong> as a file evolves. Diffs are the changes you made while editing: imagine you can “peel” them off and apply them to a file:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/basic_diffs.png" alt="version control diff" /></p>
<p>For example, to go from r1 to r2, we add eggs (+Eggs). Imagine peeling off that red sticker and placing it on r1, to get r2.</p>
<p>And to get from r2 to r3, we add Juice (+Juice). To get from r3 to r4, we remove Juice and add Soup (-Juice, +Soup).</p>
<p>Most version control systems <strong>store diffs rather than full copies of the file</strong>. This saves disk space: 4 revisions of a file doesn’t mean we have 4 copies; we have 1 copy and 4 small diffs. Pretty nifty, eh? In SVN, we diff two revisions of a file like this:</p>
<pre><code>svn diff -r3:4 list.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Diffs help us notice changes (“How did you fix that bug again?”) and even apply them from one branch to another.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus question:</strong> what’s the diff from r1 to r4?</p>
<pre><code>+Eggs
+Soup
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how “Juice” wasn’t even involved — the direct jump from r1 to r4 doesn’t need that change, since Juice was overridden by Soup.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#branching" id="branching">Branching</a></h2>
<p>Branches let us copy code into a separate folder so we can monkey with it separately:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/first_branch.png" alt="version control branch" /></p>
<p>For example, we can create a branch for new, experimental ideas for our list: crazy things like Rice or Eggo waffles. Depending on the version control system, creating a branch (copy) may change the revision number.</p>
<p>Now that we have a branch, we can change our code and work out the kinks. (<em>“Hrm… waffles? I don’t know what the boss will think. Rice is a safe bet.”</em>). Since we’re in a separate branch, we can make changes and test in isolation, knowing our changes won’t hurt anyone. And our branch history is under version control.</p>
<p>In Subversion, you create a branch simply by copying a directory to another.</p>
<pre><code>svn copy http://path/to/trunk http://path/to/branch
</code></pre>
<p>So branching isn’t too tough of a concept: <strong>Pretend you copied your code into a different directory.</strong> You’ve probably branched your code in school projects, making sure you have a “fail safe” version you can return to if things blow up.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#merging" id="merging">Merging</a></h2>
<p>Branching sounds simple, right? Well, it’s not — figuring out how to merge changes from one branch to another can be tricky.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to get the “Rice” feature from our experimental branch into the mainline. How would we do this? Diff r6 and r7 and apply that to the main line?</p>
<p><strong>Wrongo.</strong> We only want to apply the changes <strong>that happened in the branch!</strong>. That means we diff r5 and r6, and apply that to the main trunk:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/merging.png" alt="version control merge" /></p>
<p>If we diffed r6 and r7, we would lose the “Bread” feature that was in main. This is a subtle point — imagine “peeling off” the changes from the experimental branch (+Rice) and adding that to main. Main may have had other changes, which is ok — we just want to insert the Rice feature.</p>
<p>In Subversion, merging is very close to diffing. Inside the main trunk, run the command:</p>
<pre><code>svn merge -r5:6 http://path/to/branch
</code></pre>
<p>This command diffs r5-r6 in the experimental branch and applies it to the current location. Unfortunately, Subversion doesn’t have an easy way to keep track of what merges have been applied, so if you’re not careful you may apply the same changes twice. It’s a planned feature, but the current advice is to keep a changelog message reminding you that you’ve already merged r5-r6 into main.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#conflicts" id="conflicts">Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>Many times, the VCS can automatically merge changes to different parts of a file. <strong>Conflicts</strong> can arise when changes appear that don’t gel: Joe wants to remove eggs and replace it with cheese (-eggs, +cheese), and Sue wants to replace eggs with a hot dog (-eggs, +hot dog).</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/vcs_conflict.png" alt="version control conflict" /></p>
<p>At this point it’s a race: if Joe checks in first, that’s the change that goes through (and Sue can’t make her change).</p>
<p>When changes overlap and contradict like this, the VCS may report a <strong>conflict</strong> and not let you check in — it’s up to you to check in a newer version that <strong>resolves</strong> this dilemma. A few approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Re-apply your changes</strong>. Sync to the the latest version (r4) and re-apply your changes to this file: Add hot dog to the list that already has cheese.</li>
<li><strong>Override their changes with yours</strong>. Check out the latest version (r4), copy over your version, and check your version in. In effect, this removes cheese and replaces it with hot dog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conflicts are infrequent but can be a pain. Usually I update to the latest and re-apply my changes.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tagging" id="tagging">Tagging</a></h2>
<p>Who would have thought a version control system would be Web 2.0 compliant? Many systems let you tag (label) any revision for easy reference. This way you can refer to “Release 1.0” instead of a particular build number:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/tagging.png" alt="version control tag" /></p>
<p>In Subversion, tags are just branches that you agree not to edit; they are around for posterity, so you can see exactly what your version 1.0 release contained. Hence they end in a stub — there’s nowhere to go.</p>
<pre><code>(in trunk)
svn copy http://path/to/revision http://path/to/tag
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#real-life-example-managing-windows-source-code" id="real-life-example-managing-windows-source-code">Real-Life Example: Managing Windows Source Code</a></h2>
<p>We guessed that Windows was managed out of a shared folder, but it’s not the case. So <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/01/364840.aspx">how’s it done</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a <strong>main line</strong> with stable builds of Windows.</li>
<li>Each group (Networking, User Interface, Media Player, etc.) <strong>has its own branch</strong> to develop new features. These are under development and less stable than main.</li>
</ul>
<p>You develop new features in your branch and “Reverse Integrate (RI)” to get them into Main. Later, you “Forward Integrate” to bring the latest changes from Main into your branch:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/windows.png" alt="version control branch example" /></p>
<p>Let’s say we’re at Media Player 10 and IE 6. The Media Player team makes version 11 in their own branch. When it’s ready and tested, there’s a patch from 10 – 11 which is applied to Main (just like the “Rice” example, but a tad more complicated). This is a <strong>reverse integration</strong>, from the branch to the trunk. The IE team can do the same thing.</p>
<p>Later, the Media Player team can pick up the latest code from other teams, like IE. In this case, Media Player <strong>forward integrates</strong> and gets the latest patches from main into their branch. This is like pulling in the “Bread” feature into the experimental branch, but again, more complicated.</p>
<p>So it’s RI and FI. Aye aye. This arrangement lets changes percolate throughout the branches, while keeping new code out of the main line. Cool, eh?</p>
<p>In reality, there’s many layers of branches and sub-branches, along with quality metrics that determine when you get to RI. But you get the idea: branches help manage complexity. Now you know the basics of how one of the largest software projects is organized.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#key-takeaways" id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</a></h2>
<p>My goal was to share high-level thoughts about version control systems. Here are the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use version control.</strong> Seriously, it’s a good thing, even if you’re not writing an OS. It’s worth it for backups alone.</li>
<li><strong>Take it slow.</strong> I’m only now looking into branching and merging for my projects. Just get a handle on using version control and go from there. If you’re a small project, branching/merging may not be an issue. Large projects often have experienced maintainers who keep track of the branches and patches.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Learning.</strong> There’s plenty of guides for <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">SVN</a>, <a href="http://wwwasd.web.cern.ch/wwwasd/cvs/tutorial/cvs_tutorial_toc.html">CVS</a>, <a href="http://agave.garden.org/%7Eaaronh/rcs/tutorial.html">RCS</a>, <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">Git</a>, <a href="http://public.perforce.com/public/tutorial.html">Perforce</a> or whatever system you’re using. The important thing is to <strong>know the concepts</strong> and realize every system has its own lingo and philosophy. Eric Sink has a <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html">detailed version control guide</a> also.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basics — as time goes on I’ll share specific lessons I’ve learned from <a href="http://instacalc.com/">my projects</a>. Now that you’ve figured out a regular VCS, <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intro-to-distributed-version-control-illustrated/">try an illustrated guide to distributed version control</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#intro-to-distributed-version-control-illustrated" id="intro-to-distributed-version-control-illustrated">Intro to Distributed Version Control (Illustrated)</a></h1>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/">BetterExplained</a></p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/distributed_logo.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Traditional version control helps you backup, track and synchronize files. Distributed version control makes it easy to share changes. Done right, you can get the best of both worlds: simple merging and centralized releases.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#distributed-whats-wrong-with-regular-version-control" id="distributed-whats-wrong-with-regular-version-control">Distributed? What’s Wrong With Regular Version Control?</a></h2>
<p>Nothing — read <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/">a visual guide to version control</a> if you want a quick refresher. Sure, <em>some people</em> will deride you for using an “ancient” system. But you’re still OK in my book: using <em>any</em> VCS is a positive step forward for a project.</p>
<p>Centralized VCS emerged from the 1970s, when programmers had thin clients and admired “big iron” mainframes (how can you <em>not</em> like a machine with a then-gluttonous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System/360">8 bits to a byte</a>?).</p>
<p><strong>Centralized is simple</strong>, and what you’d first invent: a single place everyone can check in and check out. It’s like a library where you get to scribble in the books.</p>
<p>This model works for backup, undo and synchronization but isn’t great for merging and branching changes people make. As projects grow, you want to split features into chunks, developing and testing in isolation and slowly merging changes into the main line. In reality, branching is cumbersome, so new features may come as a giant checkin, making changes difficult to manage and untangle if they go awry.</p>
<p>Sure, merging is always “possible” in a centralized system, but it’s not easy: you often need to track the merge yourself to avoid making the same change twice. Distributed systems make branching and merging painless because they rely on it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#a-few-diagrams-please" id="a-few-diagrams-please">A Few Diagrams, Please</a></h2>
<p>Other tutorials have plenty of nitty-gritty text commands; here’s a <strong>visual</strong> look. To refresh, developers use a central repo in a typical VCS:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/centralized_example.png" alt="centralized version control" /></p>
<p>Everyone syncs and checks into the main trunk: Sue adds soup, Joe adds juice, and Eve adds eggs.</p>
<p>Sue’s change must go into main before it can be seen by others. Yes, theoretically Sue <em>could</em> make a new branch for other people to try out her changes, but this is a pain in a regular VCS.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#distributed-version-control-systems-dvcs" id="distributed-version-control-systems-dvcs">Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)</a></h2>
<p>In a distributed model, every developer has their own repo. Sue’s changes live in her local repo, which she can share with Joe or Eve:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/distributed_example.png" alt="distributed version control example" /></p>
<p>But will it be a circus with no ringleader? Nope. If desired, everyone can push changes into a common repo, suspiciously like the centralized model above. This franken-repo contains the changes of Sue, Joe and Eve.</p>
<p><strong>I wish distributed version control had a different name</strong>, such as “independent”, “federated” or “peer-to-peer.” The term “distributed” evokes thoughts of distributed computing, where work is split among a grid of machines (like searching for signals with <a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a> or doing <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/">protein folding</a>).</p>
<p>A DVCS is not like Seti@home: each node is completely independent and sharing is optional (in Seti you must phone back your results).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#key-concepts-in-5-minutes" id="key-concepts-in-5-minutes">Key Concepts In 5 Minutes</a></h2>
<p>Here’s the basics; there’s a <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_darcs/Patch_theory">book</a> on patch theory if you’re interested.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized version control focuses on <strong>synchronizing, tracking, and backing up files.</strong></li>
<li>Distributed version control focuses on <strong>sharing changes</strong>; every change has a <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/the-quick-guide-to-guids/">guid or unique id</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recording/Downloading</strong> and <strong>applying</strong> a change are separate steps (in a centralized system, they happen together).</li>
<li><strong>Distributed systems have no forced structure</strong>. You can create “centrally administered” locations or keep everyone as peers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Terminology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>push</strong>: send a change to another repository (may require permission)</li>
<li><strong>pull</strong>: grab a change from a repository</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone has a local sandbox.</strong> You can make changes and roll back, all on your local machine. No more giant checkins; your incremental history is in your repo.</li>
<li><strong>It works offline.</strong> You only need to be online to share changes. Otherwise, you can happily stay on your local machine, checking in and undoing, no matter if the “server” is down or you’re on an airplane.</li>
<li><strong>It’s fast.</strong> Diffs, commits and reverts are all done locally. There’s no shaky network or server to ask for old revisions from a year ago.</li>
<li><strong>It handles changes well.</strong> Distributed version control systems were <em>built</em> around sharing changes. Every change has a guid which makes it easy to track.</li>
<li><strong>Branching and merging is easy.</strong> Because every developer “has their own branch”, every shared change is like reverse integration. But the guids make it easy to automatically combine changes and avoid duplicates.</li>
<li><strong>Less management.</strong> Distributed VCSes are easy to get running; there’s no “always-running” server software to install. Also, DVCSes may not require you to “add” new users; you just pick what URLs to pull from. This can avoid political headaches in large projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You still need a backup.</strong> Some claim your “backup” is the other machines that have your changes. I don’t buy it — what if they didn’t accept them all? What if they’re offline and you have new changes? With a DVCS, you still want a machine to push changes to “just in case”. (In Subversion, you usually dedicate a machine to store the main repo; do the same for a DVCS).</li>
<li><strong>There’s not really a “latest version”</strong>. If there’s no central location, you don’t immediately know whether to see Sue, Joe or Eve for the latest version. Again, a central location helps clarify what the latest “stable” release is.</li>
<li><strong>There aren’t really revision numbers.</strong> Every repo has its own revision numbers depending on the changes. Instead, people refer to change numbers: <em>Pardon me, do you have change fa33e7b?</em> (Remember, the id is an ugly guid). Thankfully, you can tag releases with meaningful names.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mercurial-quickstart" id="mercurial-quickstart">Mercurial Quickstart</a></h2>
<p>Mercurial is a fast, simple DVCS. The nickname is hg, like the element Mercury.</p>
<pre><code>cd project
hg init                                (create repo here)
hg add list.txt                        (start tracking file)
hg commit -m &quot;Added file&quot;              (check file into local repo)
hg log                                 (see history; notice guid)

changeset:   0:55bbcb7a4c24
user:        Kalid@kazad-laptop
date:        Sun Oct 14 21:36:18 2007 -0400
summary:     Added file

[edit file]
hg revert list.txt                 (revert to previous version)

hg tag v1.0                        (tag this version)
[edit file]
hg update -C v1.0                  (&quot;update&quot; to the older tagged version; -C forces overwrite of local copy)
</code></pre>
<p>Once Mercurial has initialized a directory, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/distributed_repo_layout.png" alt="distributed version control repo layout" /></p>
<p>You have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A working copy</strong>. The files you are currently editing.</li>
<li><strong>A repository</strong>. A directory (.hg in Mercurial) containing all patches and metadata (comments, guids, dates, etc.). There’s no central server so the data stays with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our distributed example, Sue, Joe and Eve have their own repos, with independent revision histories.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#understanding-updates-and-merging" id="understanding-updates-and-merging">Understanding Updates And Merging</a></h2>
<p>There’s a few items that confused me when learning about DVCS. First, updates happen in several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting</strong> the change into a repo (pushing or pulling)</li>
<li><strong>Applying</strong> the change to the files (update or merge)</li>
<li><strong>Saving</strong> the new version (commit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, depending on the change, you can update or merge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updates</strong> happen when there’s no ambiguity. For example, I pull changes to a file that only you’ve been editing. The file just jumps to the latest revision, since there’s no overlapping changes.</li>
<li><strong>Merges</strong> are needed when we have conflicting changes. If we both edit a file, we end up with two “branches” (i.e. alternate universes). One world has my changes, the other world has yours. In this case we (probably) want to merge the changes together into a single universe.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m still wrapping my head around how easily branches spring up and collapse in a DVCS:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/distributed_merge.png" alt="distributed version control merge changes" /></p>
<p>In this case, a merge is needed because (+Soup) and (+Juice) are changes to a common parent: the list with just “Milk”. After Joe merges the files, Sue can do a regular “pull and update” to get the combined file from Joe. She doesn’t have to merge again on her own.</p>
<p>In Mercurial you can run:</p>
<pre><code>hg incoming ../another-dir  (see pending changes)
hg pull ../another-dir      (download changes)

hg update                   (actually apply changes...)
hg merge                    (... or merge if needed)

hg commit                   (check in merged file; unite branches)
</code></pre>
<p>Yep, the “pull-merge-commit” cycle is long. Luckily, Mercurial has shortcuts to combine commands into a single one. Though it seems complex, it’s much easier than handling merges manually in Subversion.</p>
<p><strong>Most merges are automatic.</strong> When conflicts come up, they are typically resolved quickly. Mercurial keeps track of the parent/child relationship for every change (our merged list has two parents), as well as the “heads” or latest changes in each branch. Before the merge we have two heads; afterwards, one.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#organizing-a-distributed-project" id="organizing-a-distributed-project">Organizing A Distributed Project</a></h2>
<p>Here’s one way to organize a distributed project:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/distributed_push_pull.png" alt="distributed version control push pull model" /></p>
<p>Sue, Joe and Eve check changes into a common branch. They can trade patches with each other to do simple “buddy builds”: <em>Hey buddy, can you try out these patches? I need to see if it works before I push to the experimental branch.</em></p>
<p>Later, a maintainer can review and pull changes from the experimental branch into a stable branch, which has the latest release. A distributed VCS helps isolate changes but still provide the “single source” of a centralized system. There are many models of development, from “pull only” (where maintainers decide what to take, and is used when developing Linux) to “shared push” (which acts like a centralized system). A distributed VCS gives you <strong>flexibility</strong> in how a project is maintained.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#practice-and-scathing-ridicule-makes-perfect" id="practice-and-scathing-ridicule-makes-perfect">Practice And Scathing Ridicule Makes Perfect</a></h2>
<p>I’m a DVCS newbie, but am happy with what I’ve learned so far. I enjoy SVN, but it’s “fun” seeing how easy a merge can be. My suggestion is to start with Subversion, get a grasp for team collaboration, then experiment with a distributed model. With the proper layout a DVCS can do anything a centralized system can, with the added benefit of easy merging.</p>

<p>Along with a <a href="http://progit.org/book/">book</a>, <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Ecduan/technical/git/">tutorial</a> and <a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/git/quick-reference.html">cheatsheet</a>, here are the insights that helped git click.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#theres-a-staging-area" id="theres-a-staging-area">There's A Staging Area!</a></h2>
<p>Git has a staging area. <strong>Git has a staging area!!!</strong></p>
<p>Yowza, did this ever confuse me. There's both a repo (&quot;object database&quot;) and a staging area (called &quot;index&quot;). Checkins have two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>git add foo.txt
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Add foo.txt to the index. It's not checked in yet!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;message&quot;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Put staged files in the repo; they're now tracked</li>
<li>You can &quot;<code>git add --update&quot;</code> to stage all tracked, modified files</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why stage?</strong> Git's flexible: if a, b and c are changed, you can commit them separately or together.</p>
<p>But now there's two undos:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>git checkout foo.txt
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Undo local changes (like svn revert)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git reset HEAD foo.txt
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Remove from staging area (local copy still modified).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Add and commit, add and commit -- Git has a rhythm.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#branching-is-save-as" id="branching-is-save-as">Branching Is &quot;Save As...&quot;</a></h2>
<p>Branches are like &quot;Save as...&quot; on a directory. Best of all:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily merge changes with the original (changes tracked and never applied twice)</li>
<li>No wasted space (common files only stored once)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why branch?</strong> Consider the utility of &quot;Save as...&quot; for regular files: you tinker with multiple possibilities while keeping the original safe. Git enables this for directories, with the power to merge. (In practice, svn is like a single shared drive, where you can only revert to one backup).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#imagine-virtual-directories" id="imagine-virtual-directories">Imagine Virtual Directories</a></h2>
<p>I see branches as &quot;virtual directories&quot; in the .git folder. While inside a physical directory (c:\project or ~/project), you traverse virtual directories with a checkout.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>switch to master branch (&quot;cd master&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git branch dev
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>create new branch from existing (&quot;cp * dev&quot;)</li>
<li>you still need to &quot;cd&quot; with &quot;git checkout dev&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git merge dev
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>(when in master) pull in changes from dev (&quot;cp dev/* .&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git branch
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>list all branches (&quot;ls&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My inner dialogue is &quot;change to dev directory (checkout)... make changes... save changes (add/commit)... change to master directory... copy in changes from dev (merge)&quot;.</p>
<p>The physical directory is a scratchpad. Virtual directories are affected by git commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>rm foo.txt
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Remove foo.txt from your sandbox (restored if you checkout the branch again)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git rm foo.txt
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Remove foo.txt from current virtual directory</li>
<li>Gotcha: you need to commit that change!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#know-the-current-branch" id="know-the-current-branch">Know The Current Branch</a></h2>
<p>Just like seeing your current directory, <strong>put the current branch in your prompt!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/git/git_prompt.png" alt="git branch highlighting" /></p>
<p>In my .bash_profile:</p>
<pre><code>parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* (.*)/(1)/'
}

export PS1=&quot;[33[00m]u@h[33[01;34m] W [33[31m]$(parse_git_branch) [33[00m]$[33[00m] &quot;
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#visualize-your-branch-structure" id="visualize-your-branch-structure">Visualize Your Branch Structure</a></h2>
<p>Git leaves branch organization to you. Nvie.com has a <a href="http://nvie.com/git-model">great branch strategy</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/git/git_branch_strategy.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a mainline (master). Mentally it's on the far right.</li>
<li>Create branches (master -&gt; dev) and subbranches (dev -&gt; featureX). The further from master, the crazier.</li>
<li>Only merge with neighbors (master -&gt; dev -&gt; feature X, or featureX -&gt; dev -&gt; master)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay sane by choosing a branch layout up front. I have a master tracking a svn project, and dev for my own code. In general, master is clean so I can branch anytime for one-off fixes.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#understand-local-vs-remote" id="understand-local-vs-remote">Understand Local Vs. Remote</a></h2>
<p>Git has local and remote commands; seeing both confused me (&quot;When do you checkout vs. pull?&quot;). Work locally, syncing remotely as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Local data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>git init
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>create local repo</li>
<li>use git add/commit/branch to work locally</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>git remote add name path-to-repo
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>track a remote repo (usually &quot;origin&quot;) from an existing repo</li>
<li>remote branches are &quot;origin/master&quot;, &quot;origin/dev&quot; etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git branch -a
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>list all branches (remote and local)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git clone path-to-repo
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>create a new local git repo copied from a remote one</li>
<li>local master tracks remote master</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>merge changes from tracked remote branch (if in dev, pull from origin/dev)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>git push
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>send changes to tracked remote branch (if in dev, push to origin/dev)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why local and remote?</strong> Subversion has central checkins, so you avoid committing unfinished work. With git, local commits are frequent and you only push when ready.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#guids-are-good" id="guids-are-good">GUIDs Are GOOD</a></h2>
<p>Git addresses information by a hash (<a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/the-quick-guide-to-guids/">GUID</a>) of its contents. If two branches are the same, they have the same GUID (and vice versa).</p>
<p>Why's this cool? We can create branches independently, merge them, and have a common GUID. No central numbering needed. Usually, we just compare the first few digits: &quot;Are you on a93?&quot;.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tips--tricks" id="tips--tricks">Tips &amp; Tricks</a></h2>
<p>For your .gitconfig:</p>
<pre><code>[alias]
        ci = commit
        st = status
        co = checkout
        oneline = log --pretty=oneline
        br = branch
        la = log --pretty=&quot;format:%ad %h (%an): %s&quot; --date=short
</code></pre>
<p>There are some GUI tools for git, but I prefer to learn via the command line. Git is opinionated software (which I like), and analogies help me understand its world view.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>A <strong>software release life cycle</strong> is the sum of the stages of development and maturity for a piece of computer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>. Cycles range from its initial development to its eventual release, and include updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">software bugs</a> still present in the software.</p>
<p>Computer users are most likely to be familiar with the <em>beta</em> phase, as software products are sometimes publicly advertised as being beta in order to reduce users' expectations of their reliability.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Software_dev2.svg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Software_dev2.svg/240px-Software_dev2.svg.png" alt="img" /></a></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#stages-of-development" id="stages-of-development">Stages of development</a></h2>
<h2><a class="header" href="#pre-alpha" id="pre-alpha">Pre-alpha</a></h2>
<p>Pre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before formal testing. These activities can include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis">requirements analysis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design">software design</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development">software development</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>. In typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a> development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. <em>Milestone</em> versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the feature is complete.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#alpha" id="alpha">Alpha</a></h3>
<p>The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing">software testing</a> (alpha is the first letter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing">white-box techniques</a>. Additional validation is then performed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing">black-box</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_box_testing#Grey_box_testing">gray-box</a> techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as <em>alpha release</em>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-alphadef-2">2]</a></p>
<p>Alpha software is software that is not thoroughly tested by the developer no before it is released to customers. Alpha software may contain serious errors, and any resulting instability could cause crashes or data loss.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-3">3]</a> Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-4">4]</a> In general, external availability of alpha software is uncommon in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary software</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">open source software</a> often has publicly available alpha versions. The alpha phase usually ends with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_(software_engineering)">feature freeze</a>, indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete">feature complete</a>. A beta test is carried out following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">acceptance testing</a> at the supplier's site (alpha test) and immediately prior to general release of the software as a product.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-5">5]</a></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#beta" id="beta">Beta</a></h3>
<p>&quot;Beta test&quot; redirects here. For the film, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Test_(film)">Beta Test (film)</a>.</p>
<p>Beta, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta">the second letter of the Greek alphabet</a>, is the software development phase following alpha. Software in the beta stage is also known as <em>betaware</em>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-6">6]</a> A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-7">7]</a> Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software, speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing">usability testing</a>. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called <em>beta release</em> and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. Software beta releases can either be public or private, depending on whether they are openly available or only available to a limited audience. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a <em>preview</em>, <em>preview release</em>, <em>prototype</em>, <em>technical preview</em> / <em>technology preview</em> (<em>TP</em>),[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-8">8]</a> or <em>early access</em>. Since the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8">Windows 8</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> has called pre-release software a <em>preview</em> rather than <em>beta</em>. All pre-release builds released through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Insider_Program">Windows Insider Program</a> launched in 2014 are termed &quot;Insider Preview builds&quot;. &quot;beta&quot; may also indicate something more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate">release candidate</a>, or as a form of time-limited demo, or marketing technique.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-9">9]</a></p>
<p><em>Beta testers</em> are people who actively report issues of beta software. They are usually customers or representatives of prospective customers of the organization that develops the software. Beta testers tend to volunteer their services free of charge but often receive versions of the product they test, discounts on the release version, or other incentives.</p>

<p>Some software is kept in so-called <em>perpetual beta</em>, where new features are continually added to the software without establishing a final &quot;stable&quot; release. As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> has facilitated rapid and inexpensive distribution of software, companies have begun to take a looser approach to use of the word &quot;beta&quot;.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-10">10]</a> In February 2005, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDNet">ZDNet</a> published an article about the phenomenon of a beta version often staying for years and being used as if it were in production level.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-11">11]</a> It noted that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail">Gmail</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News">Google News</a>, for example, had been in beta for a long time although widely used; Google News did leave beta in January 2006, followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_Suite">Google Apps</a>, including Gmail, in July 2009.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-12">12]</a> This technique may allow a developer to delay offering full support and responsibility for remaining issues.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#open-and-closed-beta" id="open-and-closed-beta">Open and closed beta</a></h4>
<p>Developers may release either a <em>closed beta</em> also called <em>private beta</em>, or an <em>open beta</em> also called <em>public beta</em>; closed beta versions are released to a restricted group of individuals for a user test by invitation, while open beta testers are from a larger group, or anyone interested. Private beta could be suitable for the software that is capable of delivering value, but is not ready to be used by everyone either due to scaling issues, lack of documentation or still missing vital features. The testers report any bugs that they find, and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be available in the final version. Examples of a major public beta test include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early customers purchased a &quot;pioneer edition&quot; of the WordVision word processor for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC">IBM PC</a> for $49.95. In 1984, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Manes">Stephen Manes</a> wrote that &quot;in a brilliant marketing coup, Bruce and James Program Publishers managed to get people to <em>pay</em> for the privilege of testing the product.&quot;[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-manes19840403-13">13]</a></li>
<li>In September 2000 a <em>boxed version</em> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.">Apple</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Public_Beta">Mac OS X Public Beta</a> operating system was released.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-14">14]</a></li>
<li>Microsoft's release of <em>community technology preview</em>s (<em>CTP</em>s) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista">Windows Vista</a>, between September 2005 and May 2006.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-15">15]</a></li>
<li>From 2009 to 2011, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> was in public beta.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open betas serve the dual purpose of demonstrating a product to potential consumers, and testing among an extremely wide user base likely to bring to light obscure errors that a much smaller testing team might not find.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#release-candidate" id="release-candidate">Release candidate</a></h3>
<p>A <em>release candidate</em> (<em>RC</em>), also known as &quot;going silver&quot;, is a beta version with potential to be a stable product, which is ready to release unless significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">bugs</a> emerge. In this stage of product stabilization, all product features have been designed, coded and tested through one or more beta cycles with no known showstopper-class bugs. A release is called <em>code complete</em> when the development team agrees that no entirely new source code will be added to this release. There could still be source code changes to fix defects, changes to documentation and data files, and peripheral code for test cases or utilities. Beta testers, if privately selected, will often be credited for using the release candidate as though it were a finished product. Beta testing is conducted in a client's or customer's location and to test the software from a user's perspective.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#stable-release" id="stable-release">Stable release</a></h3>
<p>Also called <em>production release</em>, the <em>stable release</em> is the last <em>release candidate</em> (<em>RC</em>) which has passed all verifications / tests. The remaining bugs are considered as acceptable. This release goes to production. Some domains (for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">Linux distributions</a>), have two types of stable releases: normal, or stable releases and long-term support (LTS) releases which are maintained for a longer period of time.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#release" id="release">Release</a></h2>
<p>Once released, the software is generally known as a &quot;stable release&quot;. The formal term often depends on the method of release: physical media, online release or a web application.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#release-to-manufacturing-rtm" id="release-to-manufacturing-rtm">Release to manufacturing (RTM)</a></h3>
<p>The term <strong>release to manufacturing</strong> (<strong>RTM</strong>), also known as &quot;<strong>going gold</strong>&quot;, is a term used when a software product is ready to be delivered. This build may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing">digitally signed</a>, allowing the end user to verify the integrity and authenticity of the software purchase. A copy of the RTM build known as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio)">gold master</a>&quot; or GM [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-16">16]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-17">17]</a> is sent for mass duplication if applicable. This is terminology is taken from the audio record making industry, specifically the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio)">mastering</a>. RTM precedes general availability (GA) when the product is released to the public.</p>
<p>It is typically used in certain retail mass-production software contexts—as opposed to a specialized software production or project in a commercial or government production and distribution—where the software is sold as part of a bundle in a related computer hardware sale and typically where the software and related hardware is ultimately to be available and sold on mass/public basis at retail stores to indicate that the software has met a defined quality level and is ready for mass retail distribution. RTM could also mean in other contexts that the software has been delivered or released to a client or customer for installation or distribution to the related hardware end user computers or machines. The term does <em>not</em> define the delivery mechanism or volume; it only states that the quality is sufficient for mass distribution. The deliverable from the engineering organization is frequently in the form of a golden master media used for duplication or to produce the image for the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ProductEndOfLifeCycle.png"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/ProductEndOfLifeCycle.png/220px-ProductEndOfLifeCycle.png" alt="img" /></a></p>
<p>Milestones in a product life cycle: general availability (GA), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_life_announcement">end of life announcement</a> (EOLA), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_order_date">last order date</a> (LOD), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)">end-of-life</a> (EOL)</p>
<p><strong>General availability</strong> (<strong>GA</strong>) is the marketing stage at which all necessary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization">commercialization</a> activities have been completed and a software product is available for purchase, depending, however, on language, region, electronic vs. media availability.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-18">18]</a> Commercialization activities could include security and compliance tests, as well as localization and worldwide availability. The time between RTM and GA can be from a week to months in some cases before a generally available release can be declared because of the time needed to complete all commercialization activities required by GA. At this stage, the software has &quot;gone live&quot;.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#release-to-the-web-rtw" id="release-to-the-web-rtw">Release to the Web (RTW)</a></h3>
<p><strong>Release to the Web</strong> (<strong>RTW</strong>) or <strong>Web release</strong> is a means of software delivery that utilizes the Internet for distribution. No physical media are produced in this type of release mechanism by the manufacturer. Web releases are becoming more common as Internet usage grows.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#support" id="support">Support</a></h2>
<p>During its supported lifetime, software is sometimes subjected to service releases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)">patches</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_pack">service packs</a>, sometimes also called &quot;interim releases&quot; or &quot;maintenance release&quot; (MR). For example, Microsoft released three major service packs for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">32-bit</a> editions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">Windows XP</a> and two service packs for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing">64-bit</a> editions. Such service releases contain a collection of updates, fixes, and enhancements, delivered in the form of a single installable package. They may also implement new features. Some software is released with the expectation of regular support. Classes of software that generally involve protracted support as the norm include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software">anti-virus suites</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">massively multiplayer online games</a>. Continuing with this Windows XP example, Microsoft did offer paid updates for five more years after the end of extended support. This means that support ended April 8, 2019.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#end-of-life" id="end-of-life">End-of-life</a></h3>
<p>See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)">End-of-life (product)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware</a></p>
<p>When software is no longer sold or supported, the product is said to have reached end-of-life, to be discontinued, retired, deprecated, abandoned, or obsolete, but user loyalty may continue its existence for some time, even long after its platform is obsolete—e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari ST</a> and Sinclair <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>After the end-of-life date, the developer will usually not implement any new features, fix existing defects, bugs or vulnerabilities (whether known before that date or not) or provide any support for the product. If the developer is kind enough, they may release the source code, so the platform will live again, and be maintained by volunteers.</p>

<p>In software management, we often change our code and all these changes need to be tracked. As our projects grow, all the dependencies of the projects increase as well. If you want to make changes to your project and move forward, you need to make sure all your dependencies works with your current changes as well. We can’t move forward if these dependencies are too tight or loosely defined. This is called dependency hell.</p>
<p>In this post, we can see how we can avoid this dependency hell and manage these dependencies. Here are the topics I cover</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is Semantic Versioning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Basic Rules</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why Should We Use It</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example Project</strong></li>
<li><strong>Version History and Precedence</strong></li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#what-is-semantic-versioning" id="what-is-semantic-versioning"><strong>What is Semantic Versioning</strong></a></h1>
<p>Semantic Versioning is introduced to avoid the dependency hell discussed above and to keep the javascript ecosystem healthy, reliable and secure. Every time we change our package, it is recommended to change the version in package.json.</p>
<p>By following this semantic versioning spec, you let other developers know the extent of your changes and whoever depend on your code can change their code accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>semantic versioning</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1><a class="header" href="#basic-rules" id="basic-rules"><strong>Basic Rules</strong></a></h1>
<p>When you follow this semantic versioning spec, it is recommended to follow these basic rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are starting a new project, start your project with version *<strong>0.1.0*</strong> and increment minor version for each release until its first production release.</li>
<li>When you are ready for the first production release, release with *<strong>1.0.0*</strong></li>
<li>If you are making incompatible changes to your package after the first release, you need to increment the *<strong>MAJOR*</strong> version. For instance, *<strong>1.0.0*</strong> becomes *<strong>2.0.0*</strong></li>
<li>If you are adding any functionality without any breaking or incompatible changes to your existing package, you need to increment the *<strong>MINOR*</strong> version. For instance, *<strong>1.0.0*</strong> becomes *<strong>1.1.0*</strong></li>
<li>If you are fixing any bugs without any breaking or incompatible changes to your existing package, you need to increment the *<strong>PATCH*</strong> version. For instance, *<strong>1.0.0*</strong> becomes *<strong>1.0.1*</strong></li>
<li>If your package is unstable, you should add a *<strong>LABEL*</strong> indicating that your package doesn’t meet with intended requirements. For instance, *<strong>1.0.0*</strong> becomes *<strong>1.0.0-beta*</strong> or *<strong>1.0..0-beta.1*</strong></li>
<li>You can add build metadata to this version as well with the *<strong>+*</strong> appending at the end. For instance, *<strong>1.0.0-beta+1122*</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1><a class="header" href="#why-should-we-use-it" id="why-should-we-use-it"><strong>Why Should We Use It</strong></a></h1>
<p>There are so many advantages to using this spec. Some of them are follows</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to track the changes with versions.</li>
<li>With version numbers, it’s easy to understand the changes with the new release.</li>
<li>Developers will have the option of going back to the older version if the newer version doesn't work with their code.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1><a class="header" href="#example-project" id="example-project"><strong>Example Project</strong></a></h1>
<p>Let’s put theory into practice by working on the example project.</p>
<p>We have a module called NameUtils with two methods firstName and lastName which takes fullName and gives you first name and last name respectively.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#first-release" id="first-release">First Release</a></h2>
<p>We have a version <strong>1.0.0</strong> in package.json since we are releasing it for the first time.</p>
<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/b52f606a30393a8dead9a5f29f3cbb43" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="640" width="680" title="semantic versioning" class="s t u hy ai" scrolling="auto" style="box-sizing: inherit; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 680px; height: 640px;"></iframe>
<p><strong>NameUtils package</strong></p>
<p>Let’s publish this module with <code>npm publish</code>and check the version in <code>npmjs.</code></p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ElNUNefvI6teGyTCvTF0pQ.png?q=20" alt="Image for post" /></p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1018/1*ElNUNefvI6teGyTCvTF0pQ.png" alt="Image for post" /></p>
<p><strong>nameutils version 1.0.0</strong></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#patch-release" id="patch-release">Patch Release</a></h2>
<p>If we fix any errors, we need to bump up the patch number.</p>
<p>If you look at the <code>index.js</code> file. we are returning the first name by splitting the given name by space <code>name.split(' ')[0].</code></p>
<p>You might get an error if the name is not passed to that firstName function. Let’s fix this one and republish with version *<strong>1.0.1.*</strong></p>
<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/e3e6142d9372358c626bca7c0b5f8578" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="190" width="680" title="semantic versionng" class="s t u hy ai" scrolling="auto" style="box-sizing: inherit; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 680px; height: 190px;"></iframe>

<p><strong>nameutils version 1.0.1</strong></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#minor-release" id="minor-release">Minor Release</a></h2>
<p>If we add any functionality to our existing package with backward-compatible changes, that would be *<strong>minor*</strong> release.</p>
<p>Let’s add another function called *<strong>getLength()*</strong> function to give you the length and also add the README.md file as well.</p>
<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/2b1c3de8a3414c8645f991db0c6d4bab" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="104" width="680" title="semantic versioning" class="s t u hy ai" scrolling="auto" style="box-sizing: inherit; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 680px; height: 104px;"></iframe>
<p><strong>index.js</strong></p>
<p>After publishing above changes with version *<strong>1.1.0.*</strong> Here is the updated version in the npm registry.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Pg4Emh-J4qa3aaY5zkU0pQ.png?q=20" alt="Image for post" /></p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1489/1*Pg4Emh-J4qa3aaY5zkU0pQ.png" alt="Image for post" /></p>
<p><strong>npmutils version 1.1.1 with README.md</strong></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#major-release" id="major-release">Major Release</a></h2>
<p>If we change any version with breaking changes without backward-compatibility, that would be our *<strong>major*</strong> release.</p>
<p>I want to change the function names from <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> to <code>getFirstName</code> and <code>getLastName</code> respectively.</p>
<p>This is a major version because whoever uses this package need to change their code. Let’s add and publish it with version *<strong>2.0.0*</strong></p>
<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/20c68d1cba6808557e0b88ef8c6403e2" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="190" width="680" title="semantic versioning" class="s t u hy ai" scrolling="auto" style="box-sizing: inherit; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 680px; height: 190px;"></iframe>
<p><strong>index.js</strong></p>
<p>Here is the updated version in the npm</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/1*hVeH3ZLboMysWFtyrHnr5g.png" alt="Image for post" /></p>
<p><strong>npmutils 2.0.0</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1><a class="header" href="#version-history-and-precedence" id="version-history-and-precedence"><strong>Version History and Precedence</strong></a></h1>
<p>We can check the version history in npm by going to versions tab like below and you can click on any version to see the details.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*uWOEnjH9J6L5X_yWSgdS5A.png?q=20" alt="Image for post" /></p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1501/1*uWOEnjH9J6L5X_yWSgdS5A.png" alt="Image for post" /></p>
<p><strong>package version history</strong></p>
<p>Precedence refers to how these versions are compared based on the major, minor, patch and prerelease numbers. For instance, we have 4 versions for our package so our precedence order is *<strong>1.0.0 &lt; 1.0.1 &lt; 1.1.1 &lt; 2.0.0.*</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1><a class="header" href="#how-to-install-specific-versions" id="how-to-install-specific-versions"><strong>How to Install Specific Versions</strong></a></h1>
<p>Now we have several versions of our package in npm registry and let’s understand how we can install specific versions and update those accordingly.</p>
<p>If you install the package without any version specified, <code>npm i nameutils, </code>npm will install the latest version from the registry. In our case, it’s *<strong>2.0.0*</strong></p>
<p>If you want to install a specific version, we can use <code>@</code> a symbol like this <code>npm i nameutils@1.1.1</code></p>
<hr />
<h1><a class="header" href="#difference-between-tilde-and-caret" id="difference-between-tilde-and-caret"><strong>Difference between tilde(~) and caret(^)</strong></a></h1>
<p>package.json gets updated whenever you install any package with <code>--save.</code> Every time when you install or update dependencies, These symbols caret (^) and tilde(~) makes the difference with the versions we are installing.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#" id=""><strong>~</strong></a></h1>
<p>For the specified minor version, ~ will match the most recent patch version. For instance, if you have <code>~1.3.4</code> in your package.json file and <code>1.3.6</code> and <code>1.4.0</code> are available in the npm registry <code>1.3.6</code> is installed and hold off with <code>1.4.0.</code></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#-1" id="-1">^</a></h1>
<p>For the specified major version, ^ will match the most recent minor version. For instance, if you have <code>^2.2.0</code>in your package.json file and <code>2.3.0</code>and <code>3.0.0</code> are available in the npm registry <code>2.3.0</code>is installed and hold off with <code>3.0.0</code></p>
<hr />
<h1><a class="header" href="#best-practices" id="best-practices"><strong>Best Practices</strong></a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Never change any contents of the already released version, always release the new version with changes</li>
<li>If your package is still in unstable mode, better start with the version *<strong>0.x.y.*</strong> This facilitates rapid development.</li>
<li>Only release your first version *<strong>1.0.0*</strong> when it is stable.</li>
<li>Make sure you have fewer major releases. Major release means breaking changes which include cost and lot of changes to the user who is using your code.</li>
<li>Always have good README.md file with your release which serves good communication for both users and API providers.</li>
<li>If you have deprecating changes, always put those in documentation to let the users know the changes.</li>
<li>You can release a minor version as well with those deprecating changes in place. It facilitates a smooth transition.</li>
</ul>
